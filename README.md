# etudes

"An *Ã©tude* (a French word meaning *study*) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)

The project is strongly inspired by the legendary [Norvig's pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes).
